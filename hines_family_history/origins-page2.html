                    <p class="matiu-name">A picture of Matiu Tuteau Te Atatu - source unknown.</p>
                    <p>Matiu Tuteau Te Atatu was born in Tauranga, Bay of Plenty, New Zealand in 1884.  He was the son of Te Atatu Te Whakaturou Matiu and Heeni Te Hikuwai Paraone. Te Atatu was also known by the name of Kohu or Fog. A missionary Elder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints documented the names of the children of Te Atatu Te Whakaturou Matiu in about 1960. Of this he wrote:
                    </p>        
                    <p class="matiu-extract">“Most of the children of Te Atatu used the name of Kohu to some degree or another, however, some used the the true name of their father as their own surname.  Some of the children and even grand-children were known by the surname of Te Atatu.  Te Atatu’s eldest son, Nepia, was known as Nepia Te Atatu throughout his life.  At his dath bed he called his children around him and told them his dying wish was that he wanted them to be know by his name of Nepia.  This wish they have kept.  They are still known today as the Nepia family and they live in Judea.
                    </p>
                    <p class="matiu-extract">Another of Te Atatu’s sons, Hirini, did not use his father’s true name, or his nickname of Kohu.  It seems that Te Atatu had another name by which he was known only to a few, the name of Whakaturou.  Hirini was known as Hirini Whaturou.  This name was not continued by his family and today they use the name Kohu.
                    </p>  
                    <p class="matiu-extract">Most of the rest of the family used the name of Kohu.  Peri and Karora, their children and grand-children were and are still known by the name of Kohu, and most of them live in or nearby Judea today.
                    </p>
                    <p class="matiu-extract">Matiu was know through most of his life as Sam Kohu, although his proper name was Matiu Te Atatu.  The name of Sam was given to him because he worked for a man named Sam Darragh.  In his last days he told his children that it was his wish that they all use his name of Matiu as their family name, thus they kept their father’s wish.  Today they are the Matthews family.” Extract of document written by Elder Gary N Sheffield circa 1960.
                    </p>
                    <p>Matthews is the english translation of Matiu.  As can be seen from what Elder Sheffield wrote, the Nepia, Kohu, and Matthews families are all descended from Te Atatu Te Whaturou Matiu and we are all the same family.

                    <p class="haeana-name" >A picture of Haeana Wi Hemara taken from the headstone of his grave.</p>
                    <p>Haeana Wi-Hemara was born in 1890 in Manawatu, the son of Haeana Hemara and Kararaina Wi.</p>
                    <p>Haeana Wi-Hemara was the first to use the name of Hines after being called Hines by pakeha (Europeans), who could not say his Maori name.  It was during a period when Maori were being encouraged to have a surname to “fit” into European society and was common for the father’s first name to be adopted as the surname of his children.</p>  
                    <p>Haeana incorporated Hines into his name and was known by a few aliases including Hines Wi-Hemara, William Hines and Bill Hines.  His children all used the surname of Hines.</p>     <p>I’m not sure where he got the William from although it was possibly someone saying we will call you William instead of Wi-Hemara.  At the time it was not seen as politically incorrect to just change someone’s name - so different from what is acceptable today.</p>  
                    <p>While some family members continue to use the name of Hines, extended family members also use the surname of Haeana-Hines, Haeana, and Haeana Wi-Hemara.  Despite all the different surnames we are all part of the same family.</p>

                    <p>Mum was born in Dunedin, Otago, New Zealand.  At the age of one her family moved to Kaitaia in the very far north of New Zealand.  Nanny was also born in Kaitaia but was raised in the little settlement of Ahipara nestled at the southern end of Ninety Mile Beach.  It was at Ahipara that Mum lived with her maternal grandparents until she was five and started school.  Days were spent at the beach or on the farm, collecting chicken eggs or watching Gran-Nan milk the cows.  It was an idyllic early childhood.   Once she started school she moved to Kaitaia with the rest of the family where she completed all of her primary, intermediate and secondary schooling.  Kaitaia will always be home to Mum.

                    <p>Dad was born in Raetihi, Waimarino-Manawatu, New Zealand.  When he was little he lived with his Mum and younger brother at Himitangi on the family farm with his Dad.  At age four, his father passed away with an unexpected illness and he and his Mum and younger brother were chased from the farm by his faither’s siblings.  Nanny returned to Raeithi where she had lived prior to having Dad.  He lived in Raeithi until Nanny Tuahine passed away when he was 13.  After that he was forced to move to Wanganui with his older sister Carol and her husband Colin along with Uncle Louis.  When he was 18 he moved to Kaitaia with his best friend Tai which is where he and Mum eventually met in 1984.

                    <p>Mum and Dad were married in 1989 in Kaitaia.  They moved to Auckland and Dad worked while Mum continued to attend University.  TC, H-L and LAW were all born in Auckland, New Zealand at the National Womens Hospital at Greenlane New Zealand.  In 1997 the whole familiy moved to Papua New Guinea. JENH, HJH and KRH were all born in Port Moresby, National Capital District, Papua New Guinea at the Private Hospital in Boroko. After an amazing seven years the family moved to the Gold Coast in Australia.  The four youngest children were all born in Australia – three in Queensland at the Gold Coast Hospital and one in New South Wales at the Tweed Heads Hospital.

                    <p>Despite our different countries of birth we all identify as New Zealand Maori even though the seven youngest children have never lived in New Zealand for any significant period of time. Our family also has a strong connection with Papua New Guinea from the friendships that were made during our time there.  You will see as our family tree extends backwards that even though we identify as New Zealand Maori, are large part of our family ancestors originate from England, Ireland and Scotland.  Our family is really a melting pot of lots of international parts.  "Home" now is where we live no matter where that may be.
