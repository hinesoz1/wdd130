    <h2>Larissa Hines</h2>
    <p>Hi all - my name is Larissa and I currently live in Melbourne Australia.  I have lived in Australia for the last 18 years but originally hail from the beautiful land of Aotearoa or New Zealand. </p> 
    <p>I have ten amazing children and 15 beautiful grandchildren.  My husband is working hard (I hope) on the other side of the veil.   I look forward to seeing him again although I am definitely not in a hurry to do so.  </p>
    <p>I have been studying part-time at BYU-Idaho since 2018 after doing the Pathway Connect program.  My current focus is on Family History and I have two papers to complete to obtain my second certificate in Advanced Family History.  I have developed a love of family history late in life but love the idea of being able to connect generations together.  My third certificate for my degree will be in Web design and development - I thought it might be useful in the future to be able to design and manage my own website.  Probably highly overambitious as I have no real idea of what is involved - the blissfulness of the ignorant!  This is all new to me but I am excited to learn and get to know you all.</p>
